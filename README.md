# TwsApiCpp
A lightweight layer around the portable and a platform independant C++ IB API.    It hides all the extra complexities introduced by IB in their POSIX API.    It adds extra robustness, ease of use, and safegaurds the user from inadvertently corrupting the IB internal library.    It is backward compatible with the non posix versions and with older versions of the TWS.
